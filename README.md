# Life of CitiBike

This repository contains various files that I generated as part of my quest to animate the daily and/or weekly
lifecycle of New York City's CitiBike system. All of the scoping, done in Python using Jupyter notebooks, is here, as
 are various toy datasets generated along the way, and&mdash;critically&mdash;the scripts which generate the
 visualization's backend. The only thing *not* in this repository is the final visualization itself, which is
 optimized for and hosted at my personal website, and can be found [there](https://github.com/ResidentMario/mysite/blob/master/templates/visualizations/life-of-a-citibike.html).

If you are interested in following along, read this technical blog post first. Then, if you're still interested,
start reading the materials in the `notebooks` folder.
